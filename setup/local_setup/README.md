### Local Setup using **task**
- Task file describes various execution tasks via yaml, and its core is written in go; it is more modern and easier
    to use than Makefileâ€™s tab splitting and bash combination syntax
- Documentation: [Task file](https://taskfile.dev/usage/)
#### How to install task file
- Run below command to install task
   ```commandline
    sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d
   ```
  Doc :[installation](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)

#### Use below task commands to setup CA extractor locally.
1. Clone **legal-beagles** git repo
   1. First, go to https://gitlab.unicourt.net/codaxtr/garuda/legal-beagles and fork the repo.
   2. Then, clone the forked repo inside your workspace.
   3. After cloning, you should see directory named **legal-beagles**.
   4. Change the directory to **legal-beagles** and add upstream url for **legal-beagles**.
    ```shell
    git remote add upstream git@gitlab.unicourt.net:codaxtr/garuda/legal-beagles.git
    ```
2. Setup worker locally
   1. Run below task command to setup and run worker container.
   ```shell
    task all
    ```
---
### Task commands does following things.
   1. Install repository tools by running "python3 install.py" inside the "setup/local_setup/repo_tools" directory.
      ```shell
      cd setup/local_setup/repo_tools
      python3 install.py
      ```
      - The above command will install a pre-commit hook for git.The hook checks for mixed indentations. ie files indented using tabs and spaces. Ideally, we should either tabs OR spaces but not both.
   2. Create a new "docker-compose.yml" file in your project folder. If it already exists, this step is skipped.
      - Here we copy `setup/local_setup/sample-docker-compose.yml` file inside your project folder with name `docker-compose.yml`.
      - We skip this step if `docker-compose.yml` file is already exist.
   3. Add secrets to the "docker-compose.yml" file, reading them from AWS Secret Manager.
      - We read secrets from AWS secret manager and add them to `docker-compose.yml` file.
   4. Build worker and patch docker container.
      ```shell
      docker-compose up -d --build --remove-orphans
      ```
      - The above command creates worker and patch docker container.
      -   **--remove-orphans** : Allows the user to remove containers which were created in a previous run of docker-compose up, but which has since been deleted from the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   6. Run celery in worker container
      ```shell
         docker exec -it worker-legal-beagles sh -c  "celery -A extractor_celery worker -Q worker_download_document,worker_pc_refresh_case_by_case_number,worker_pc_docket_processing,worker_pc_history_processing,worker_pc_relate_case,worker_pc_county_import_case,worker_pc_parse_file,worker_pc_extractor_webhook,worker_pc_p_refresh_case_by_case_number,worker_pc_p_docket_processing,worker_pc_p_history_processing,worker_pc_p_download_document,worker_pc_p_extractor_webhook,worker_pc_case_decision_parsing,worker_pc_tp_refresh_case_by_case_number,worker_pc_tp_docket_processing,worker_pc_tp_history_processing,worker_pc_tp_download_document,worker_pc_tp_extractor_webhook,worker_extractor,worker_docket_processing,worker_history_processing,worker_relate_case,worker_county_import_case,worker_date_range_download,worker_parse_file,worker_schedule_run,worker_import_document_health_check,worker_case_extraction_health_check,worker_proxy_health_check,worker_ramp_up_date_range_extractor,worker_ramp_up_incremental_extractor,worker_ramp_up_date_range_download_extractor --loglevel=info --concurrency 1 -n w1.%h -Ofair --without-mingle --without-gossip --without-heartbeat -P solo --prefetch-multiplier=1"
      ```
      - The above command runs celery command inside worker container.
      - **exec** : Execute a command in a running container
      - **-c** : Runs command inside container.
      - Alternative command
         ``` shell
          docker exec -it worker-legal-beagles sh
          # Run celery command inside container manually.
          celery -A extractor_celery worker -Q worker_download_document,worker_pc_refresh_case_by_case_number,worker_pc_docket_processing,worker_pc_history_processing,worker_pc_relate_case,worker_pc_county_import_case,worker_pc_parse_file,worker_pc_extractor_webhook,worker_pc_p_refresh_case_by_case_number,worker_pc_p_docket_processing,worker_pc_p_history_processing,worker_pc_p_download_document,worker_pc_p_extractor_webhook,worker_pc_case_decision_parsing,worker_pc_tp_refresh_case_by_case_number,worker_pc_tp_docket_processing,worker_pc_tp_history_processing,worker_pc_tp_download_document,worker_pc_tp_extractor_webhook,worker_extractor,worker_docket_processing,worker_history_processing,worker_relate_case,worker_county_import_case,worker_date_range_download,worker_parse_file,worker_schedule_run,worker_import_document_health_check,worker_case_extraction_health_check,worker_proxy_health_check,worker_ramp_up_date_range_extractor,worker_ramp_up_incremental_extractor,worker_ramp_up_date_range_download_extractor --loglevel=info --concurrency 1 -n w1.%h -Ofair --without-mingle --without-gossip --without-heartbeat -P solo --prefetch-multiplier=1
         ```

## Useful task commands
1)  Running task `--list (or task -l)` lists all tasks with a description
    -   ```bash
        task -list-all
        ```
    -   ```bash
        task -l
        ```
    -   ```bash
        task -a
        ```
